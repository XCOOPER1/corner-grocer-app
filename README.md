Records list items purchased in chronological order from the time the store opens to the time it close.

This project is the creation of an `ItemTracker` program designed to read, process, and display the frequencies of items from a given input file. It's a utility that can be used in inventory management, data analysis, or similar domains where tracking the occurrence of items is crucial. 

 Project Summary and Problem Solving

The program solves the problem of aggregating item data—specifically, counting the frequency of various items listed in an input file. It then provides functionality to display this frequency data to the user in different formats: directly, as a total count, or visually, as a histogram. This is useful for quickly understanding the distribution and frequency of items, which can aid in decision-making processes for inventory management, sales analysis, etc.

What I did will was:

Efficient Data Processing The use of a `std::map` for storing item frequencies is particularly well-done. This choice allows for efficient lookup, insertion, and update of item counts. 
Good User Interaction: The menu-driven interface provides a clear and straightforward way for users to interact with the program, enhancing usability.
Readability and Structure: The code is well-structured into functions and a class, making it easier to read, understand, and maintain.

Areas for Enhancement

1. Error Handling: Implementing more robust error handling, especially for file I/O operations and user input, could improve the program's resilience and user experience.
2. Refactoring: Some parts of the code, like file reading and histogram printing, could be refactored to improve efficiency and readability. For instance, reading the file and updating the map could potentially be optimized to minimize disk access.

Challenging Aspects

The most challenging part could have been managing the file I/O operations—reading from the input file and writing to a backup file—while ensuring data integrity and handling any potential errors gracefully.
Overcoming these challenges likely involved a combination of careful planning, testing, and possibly researching best practices for file I/O in C++.

Tools and Resources for Support

To tackle these challenges, I use  resources like the C++ Standard Library documentation, online forums like Stack Overflow), and W3shools

Transferable Skills

Data Management: The ability to efficiently process and manage data is a crucial skill that applies to many programming and data analysis tasks.
Error Handling and Debugging: Learning to robustly handle errors and debug issues are universally applicable skills in software development.
User Interface Design: Designing user-friendly interfaces is beneficial for developing any software that requires user interaction.

 Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability

Modularity: By organizing the code into functions and classes, I have made it easier to maintain and adapt. For example, adding new features or changing the data source would require minimal changes to the existing codebase.

Comments and Documentation: Adding comments and documentation would further enhance the readability and maintainability of the program.

Consistent Coding Style: Maintaining a consistent coding style throughout the project helps with readability and makes the codebase easier to understand for new developers or contributors.
